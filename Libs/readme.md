What are some linux libraries used often in C, C++?


There are many libraries in Linux that are commonly used in C and C++ programming. Here are some examples:

 *   Standard C library (libc): This is the standard C library that provides basic functionality like input/output operations, memory management, string manipulation, and math functions.

 *   GNU C Library (glibc): This is an enhanced version of the standard C library that is used by most Linux distributions. It provides additional functionality like POSIX compliance, internationalization support, and thread safety.

 *   Standard Template Library (STL): This is a collection of C++ classes and algorithms that provide data structures (such as vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms (such as sorting and searching) to make C++ programming easier and more efficient.

 *    Boost C++ Libraries: This is a set of high-quality C++ libraries that extend the functionality of the standard C++ libraries. It includes libraries for handling filesystems, networking, regular expressions, and more.

 *   OpenGL: This is a cross-platform graphics library that provides a standard API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It is commonly used for creating games, simulations, and scientific visualizations.

 *   GTK+: This is a toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in C and C++. It is used by many Linux desktop environments and applications.

 *   Qt: This is a popular cross-platform GUI toolkit that provides a set of C++ libraries for creating GUIs. It is used by many Linux desktop environments and applications.

 *   OpenCV: This is an open source computer vision library that provides a set of C++ libraries for image processing, object detection, and machine learning.
